# NBA-Hackathon: Prompt #2


In real practice:
   - Clock would be running, 

   - After every second, the site makes an API call that runs our regressoin analysis based on all of the play by play inputs.

   - Graphics and data would update to reflect most recently run analysis

   - For the purpose of the hackathon, we ran the analysis we developed and hardcoded the values in the front-end



To run the project locally, from the root directory of the project:

run `grunt build`

run `grunt serve`
